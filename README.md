In this project, I collected historical trading data for "Mofid-Gold-ETF," the most popular Gold ETF in Iran, from the Tehran Stock Exchange Technology Management Company (TSETMC). 
The primary objective was to analyze the effectiveness of a 10-day moving average trading strategy on the ETF's performance.
Data Collection:

The dataset includes daily closing prices for the "Mofid-Gold-ETF." The data was imported into Excel for analysis and was sourced directly from the TSETMC. Additionally, 
I added several columns to the dataset myself, including "Ownership," "Buy," "Sell," and "Cashflow."
Methodology:

   1. Data Preparation:
o	Cleaned and formatted the dataset to ensure accuracy.
o	Calculated the 10-day moving average for the closing prices.
o	Added and updated columns such as "Ownership," "Buy," "Sell," and "Cashflow" to provide more detailed insights.

   2. Strategy Implementation:

o	Implemented the 10-day moving average trading strategy.
o	Generated buy signals when the closing price crossed above the 10-day moving average.
o	Generated sell signals when the closing price crossed below the 10-day moving average.
   3. 	Analysis:
o	Evaluated the performance of the trading strategy by comparing the return on investment (ROI) against the buy-and-hold strategy.
o	Visualized the results using charts and graphs to illustrate the buy and sell points alongside the actual prices.

Results:
The analysis showed that the 10-day moving average trading strategy could effectively capture short-term trends in the "Mofid-Gold-ETF.
" However, according to the project's results, the buy-and-hold strategy appeared to be a better strategy for Gold ETFs. 
The strategy's performance, including the frequency and accuracy of the buy and sell signals, was compared to the overall performance of the ETF during the selected period.
